JavaScript Projects for the Tech Academy
This holds all my Projects from the Tech Academy JavaScript course. I use JavaScript to make webpages that are more dynamic. The projects in this repository very in size the main 5 I wanted to point out are listed below, the smaller drills you can find in my [Basic JavaScript](./Basic_JavaScript) folder.

## Projects:
* [Pizza Menu](./JavaScript_Projects/PizzaMenu)
* [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](./JavaScript_Projects/TicTacToe)
* [Calculator](./JavaScript_Projects/Calculator)
* [Cinemas](./JavaScript_Projects/Cinemas)
* [One Page Site](./JavaScript_Projects/OnePage)

### [Pizza Menu](./JavaScript_Projects/PizzaMenu)
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a variouis selection of toppings. It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order using JavaScript.

### [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](./JavaScript_Projects/TicTacToe)
A classic game of Tic Tac Toe. In this game the user has to play against the computer to try to get three in a row. The program uses code to randomly select the first player and to add sound whenever an X or O is placed as well as if a wincondition is met.

### [Calculator](./JavaScript_Projects/Calculator)
This is a sleak web calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

### [Cinemas](./JavaScript_Projects/Cinemas)
This is a moc cinema website made using bootsrap. This project is very similar to the [Movie theater project](https://github.com/Isaiahdj/HTML-CSS_projects/tree/main/Movie_Theater_BS) I did in my html and css repository,  the main difference being the functionality of the form. This new version makes the form a pop up rather then just always there.

### [One Page Site](./JavaScript_Projects/OnePage)
This is a webpage that has an embeded video, pictures, and a form users can fill out and is very similar to my [One page project](https://github.com/Isaiahdj/HTML-CSS_projects/tree/main/One_Page_Website) in my html and css repository. The main difference between the two is in this new project I added a light box for the 9 pictures that is trigured when an image is clicked.
